# abstract-section

The abstract-section filter is versioned using [Semantic
Versioning][].

[Semantic Versioning]: https://semver.org/

## v1.2.0

Released 2023-04-27.

- The restriction for abstracts to always be at level 1 was
  relaxed: it is now enough if there is no higher level heading
  before the abstract in the document. This makes it easier to use
  the filter with shifted heading levels.
